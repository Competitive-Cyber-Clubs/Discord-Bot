## How to contribute

Thanks for reading this because I am always looking to collaborate with other people to see their ideas.

Currently all development is done on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/ccc-bot) and mirror to other repositories. I recommend checking to project out there because it has all the issues and requests.
If you are looking to submit a pull request then please do so on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/ccc-bot) because all development is done there. Any pull request that is opened on GitHub will be closed and I mirror it on GitLab.  

Please open issues on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/ccc-bot/issues). if you do not have a GitLab account, send then please email service desk([incoming+cyb3r-jak3-ccc-bot-15469862-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com](mailto:incoming+cyb3r-jak3-ccc-bot-15469862-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com)).

## Documentation

All of the cog, functions, etc should be documented in a way that allows for people with an understanding of python to get how the information flows through the bot. If you would like easier understand, then I recommend checking out the project on [sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/gitlab.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/ccc-bot).

### Commands

When adding a new command the format should be `verb-noun`, i.e. `search-school`, `add-school`.

### Cogs

When adding a new cog make sure that it is added to [cogs/__init__.py](cogs/__init__.py) and documented there. A good example cog to copy and get started with is [cog/regions.py](cogs/regions.py).
