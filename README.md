# CCC-Bot

This is a bot for the CCC Discord. It is made specifically for it, so it has been highly tailored to meet the unique requirements of it.
As such it is not recommended for most other discord channels, however it is something that you should be able to learn from to create your own.

Bandit is will warn about a possible SQL injection with both SQL queries. However, I am using sqlite the recommended way to prevent injection attacks. If you are able to preform an SQL injection or other attack please contact me so that I can look into it.
